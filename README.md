# 2D Face reconstruction using SFSNet using Tensorflow

This repository entirely reproduces the work done by Sengupta et. al. from University of Maryland and published in CVPR 2018. 
Please refer the [Project Page](https://senguptaumd.github.io/SfSNet/) and the [Github repo](https://github.com/senguptaumd/SfSNet) for further details. The technical details can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01261.pdf).

## Features
1. Face deconstruction - It provides the normal, shading, and albedo output for every input image. 
2. Face reconstruction - It reconstructs any given face using the normal, shading and albedo deconstruction results. 

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements
All the requirements can be found in the requirements.txt above. To install all the required dependencies use,
